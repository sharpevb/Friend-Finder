## About
Friend Finder is a Node.js & Express web app used to find your new best friend! Enter your name, a picture of yourself (URL only), and answer ten questions about yourself. Answer each question truthfully from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Friend Finder will calculate your answers, compare them with our pool of eligible best friends, and tell you who should be your new best friend!

You can always view the pool of contestants by clicking on the "API Friends List" link at the bottom of the page.
